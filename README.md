Function - a group of code that can be called upon with a simple call to ease up space
Parameter - a variable that you use to pass things into a function, which is used to give a high number to guess to
arguments - the actual number that you use to pass into the function
while loops - loops of code that continue repeating untiil a certain condition is met, which in this project is guessing the number until the computer is correct
conditionals - things like if or else which can do other lines of code if a condtion is met
scope - a way of seeing what code is nested inside of another group, which can show code that is nested inside of a function, for example
random library - a library that we use to be able to generate random numbers
optimization - optimization was not used in this project, i think, but it can be used to make the code easier to runa nd faster, which makes it more accessible in biger scale projects and makes the amount of resources needed to run the program less.
