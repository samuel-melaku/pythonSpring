Variables - Variables hold ceratin variables that can be called on later in the code. In this project a variable was used to hold the number of wins for both the player and the computer, which was listed after you quit

Lists - lists are basically arrays, which can hold a lot of different variables, strings, or other stuff. in this project, it was used to be able to conviniently call upon rock, paper, or scissors for the computer when it generated a random number

Boolean Logic - boolean logic is just like basic logic for conditional kind of things. for example, the player does win if both the player picked rock AND the computer picks scissors

While Loops - while loops loop groups of code until a condition is met. In this project is is used to continue asking rps until the player wants to quit, which breaks the loop

Conditional - conditionals do different things depending on what the conditions are. In this project, it would tell if the player won, paper and rock, rock and scissors, that kind of stuff.

Optimization - optimization makes the code easier to runa nd less hard on resources. I dont think there were any in this project but i understand that there could have been ways to make the code harder on a computer
