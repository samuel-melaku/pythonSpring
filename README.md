Function - Functions allow you to compress large lines of code, making it more convinient to repeat them in the future
Function Parameters - Function parameters pass a number through into a function, which is used to decide the highest number in this guessnum
Function Arguments - 
Random module - the random module is a library with functions that you need to use the random functions in the code
While loop - the while loop keeps repeating a code until a condition is met, and in this code it is used to keep repeating the guess   
Boolean - True and false, which was not used in this
Indentation - makes the code easier to read and groups up important parts together
Conditionals - things like while() where the code will do something until a condition is met.
Abstraction - where you import another library of code into a new file, which allows you to use functions and other stuff more conviniently. In this project it was used to use random functions that we needed to generate a random number
