Output - output was used to tell the user if they were correct or incorrect, and it also told the user their score at the end of the game
Variables - variables like the score held data that allowed the score to be saved after the quiz was complete
Conditional - conditionals let coders do multiple different things based on what an answer may provide
Boolean - booleans were not explicitely used, but if they were then they would allow a more convinient way of basing if an answer was true or false, similar to the conditionals
Indentation - indentations allow the code to look neater, and for us to be able to see where code is nested inside of other code
pre=defined functions - predefined functions are functions that are set up to already do things. examples of this in the quizGame project are the quit(), which stops the code when the user does not want to do it, and the lower(), which allows answers to be correct regardless of case sensitive stuff
Order of precedence - order of precedence is the math stuff, like PEMDAS, and basically it makes it easire to complete math functions. in this project it is used to calculate the percentage of your grade.
